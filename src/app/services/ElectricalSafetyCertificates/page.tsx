                Electrical Safety Certificates are formally known as Electrical Installation Condition Reports (EICR).
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg mb-4"> Since all electrical installations (electrical wiring, sockets, switches,
                electrical appliances and accessories) deteriorate with use and age they should be tested and inspected
                regularly to check their condition and safety for use. </p>

                <p className="text-lg mb-4">To do this you can commission an Electrical Installation Condition Report or
                    EICR for short. (Previously
                    known as a Periodic Inspection and Testing Report (PIR)). </p>

                    <p className="text-lg mb-4"> An EICR tests the condition of the electrical installations in your
                        home or business and provides you
                        with an electrical report on their safety and highlights any defects or deviations from the
                        current
                        revision of the current electrical regulations, which you can then remedy. </p>

            It is the Landlordâ€™s responsibility to ensure that the electrical installation and appliances provided by the landlord in the property are safe at the start of the tenancy and are in proper working order throughout the tenancy.

            The Electrical Safety Council now recommends in their latest Guidance (see link below) for rented accommodation that period inspections/tests are carried out by a qualified electrician at least every 5 years or on a change of tenancy.

            If the property is a house of multiple occupation (HMO) of any kind (which will include shared houses) there is a statutory requirement to carry out such inspection/test every 5 years.

            You could be at risk of invalidating your insurance and be at risk of large fines or electrical fires without regular electrical inspections. The local authority can require a certificate to be produced in seven days if they ask.
